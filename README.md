# Registration-Form-Mobile-App
This app is used to gather the information from the attendees of the IOSCO conference. The backend contains only the initial files you need
The uploaded files contain node modules files and everthing you need. This is because the source code of the libraries in the application is edited 
Just download the files and write in the terminal "npm start"
